# API Service

This Fastify Typescript Service was created to satisfy requirement 3 from the
"Turion GSW Take Home" Document.

## Part 3: Front End Implementation

> **_NOTE:_**  
> This section omitted the "Required" tag in the documents provided.  
> I have included it in my submission, though without the "Anomaly
> Notifications" objective.

Create a telemetry dashboard that:
- [x] Real-time updates: Display the most recent telemetry values in real time.
- [x] Historical graphs or tables: Show historical telemetry data.
- [ ] Anomaly notifications: Provide real-time anomaly notifications.

The Tables do highlight anomalous rows and cells, but I don't think that's 
strong enough to satisfy the "Real-time anomaly notifications".
